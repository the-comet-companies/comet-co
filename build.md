Tight line length ✅

Generous whitespace ✅

No CTA above the fold ✅

No background animation ✅

No decorative elements ✅

Display this positioning clearly:

No hype. No buzzwords. No storytelling for its own sake. ✅

The hero should feel like a printed prospectus translated to the web. ✅

No vanity metrics. ✅
No timelines. ✅
